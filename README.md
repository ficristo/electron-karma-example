# Electron Karma Example

It uses `karma-electron` so the tests are ONLY for the renderer part of the application.

The repository is configured to work with requirejs and jquery, and so the tests.

## To try locally

`npm install -g karma-cli`
`npm install`
`npm start`

### To run the tests

`karma start` or `npm test`
